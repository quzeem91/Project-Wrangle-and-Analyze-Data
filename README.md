## by OLAMIDE QUZEEM O.

<h2>Installations</h2>
<ul>
<li>NumPy</li>
<li>pandas</li>
<li>Matplotlib</li>
<li>Seaborn</li>
<li>import tweepy</li>
<li>json</li>
<li>timeit</li> 

</ul>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>For this project, three datasets were used. Two of them were provided directly, while the third one required querying Twitter's API and writing the data to a .txt file. The datasets used are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>WeRateDogs Twitter Archive Data: This dataset contains information such as tweet ID, timestamp, rating numerator, rating denominator, name, etc.</li>
  <li>Tab Separated Values (TSV) file: This file contains images that need to be filtered to extract pictures of dogs.</li>
  <li>Querying Twitter's API: Data obtained from querying Twitter's API and writing it to a .txt file.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Insights:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The top dog breeds posted on WeRateDogs are:
    <ul>
      <li>Labrador Retriever</li>
      <li>French Bulldog</li>
      <li>Chihuahua</li>
      <li>Pembroke</li>
      <li>Eskimo Dog</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The most commonly used device by handlers for tweeting is an iPhone.</li>
  <li>December has the highest tweet rates, followed by November.</li>
  <li>There is no significant effect of the day on the tweet rate.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Reports</h2>

<p>This project consists of two reports:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Wrangle Report:</strong> This report provides detailed information about the data wrangling efforts undertaken during the project. It is framed as an internal document.</li>
  <li><strong>Wrangle Act:</strong> This report communicates all the insights and visualizations derived from the wrangled data. It is framed as an external document, similar to a blog post or a magazine article.</li>
</ol>

<p>By presenting the findings in these two reports, the audience will gain a comprehensive understanding of the data wrangling process and the insights obtained from the analysis.</p>
